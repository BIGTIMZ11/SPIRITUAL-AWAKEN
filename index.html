    <h1>THE AWAKEN</h1>
    <H2>What Does It Mean To Be Awaken?</H2>  
    <p>A spiritual awakening is a call to a higher consciousness and state of deeper mental awareness.This process typically shifts your worldview, transforming you on a personal level and shifting your mindset. It can be called by different names (enlightenment, bliss, or discovering nirvana).
 
    <h3>What triggers a spiritual awakening?</h3>
    
    
</p>
<p>A spiritual awakening can be caused by many different things. Big, life-changing events such as the death of a loved one, serious illness, or divorce can trigger a spiritual awakening, as can traumatic or near-death experiences, or an existential crisis. Other common triggers can include mental health crises and midlife (or quarter-life) crises.

For others, there may be a more subtle, gradual shift without a clear catalyst. Practising activities that promote a greater sense of self-awareness are thought to help activate a deeper conscious awareness. These can include:</p>
<li> minfdulness</li>
<li>meditation</li>
<li>caring for and connecting with plants or animals</li>
    But how do you know if you are having a spiritual awakening?
